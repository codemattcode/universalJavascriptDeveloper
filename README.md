# UJD : Universal Javascript Developer
### A more accurate alternative to Full Stack Developer. (As full stack implies comprehensive knowledge of other programming languages, C, Java, Python etc)
### Full Stack Javascript Developer also works but is slightly longer than UJD
#### Example 1 : Uses Node, Express, React (and Jquery) in conjunction with HTML, CSS to build and serve a full stack web application.
